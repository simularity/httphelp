---+ ClioPatria components

A _component_ is a DCG rule (-->)  to   be  used with html//1 to produce
_part_ of an HTML page. Components are designed to be stand-alone as far
as possible. Notably, they use  html_requires//1   to  pull  in required
script and CSS files.

The components here are designed for  the ClioPatria developers UI. Most
of them are rather simple. They  may   be  adequate  for prototyping and
developer's needs, but are generally inadequate for end-user UIs.

Components are used by _applications_.   The ClioPatria applications are
in the directory ../applications.
