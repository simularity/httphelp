---+ Supported browsers

ClioPatria as a web-platform is not browser specific. Some of the
_backoffice_ facilities (i.e., the ClioPatria web frontend) might not
work on all browsers. Development is based on
[[Firefox][http://www.mozilla.com]] (currently 3.6). In general, the
ClioPatria web frontend uses HTML that _requires_ little styling and is
made prettier using CSS. There are three areas where it uses more
advanced technology.

    * The ClioPatria menu is based on extensive use of CSS.
    * The search fields use autocompletion based on the YUI (2.7)
      AJAX framework.
    * The context graphs (see howto/ExploreRDF.txt) use SVG, embedded
      using the HTML =object= element.  The _setting_ graphviz:format
      can be used to change this into HTML5 using the
      [[canviz][http://code.google.com/p/canviz/]] library, but canviz
      is slower, does not support all graph features and is not very
      portable over browsers either.
