---+ Creating a project in ClioPatria

You can create a project inside the downloaded =ClioPatria= directory,
but often it is to be preferred to create it in a new directory.
Unfortunately, the story is different for Windows and Unix.

---++ Creating a project in Unix (Linux, MacOSX, etc.)

We assume that you created a directory next to ClioPatria. For example
using the commands below, but you can of course also use the GUI of your
OS.

    ==
    % ls
    ClioPatria
    % mkdir myproject
    % cd myproject
    ==

Now configure this directory as a ClioPatria project by running

    ==
    % ../ClioPatria/configure
    ==

This script creates a directory =|config-enabled|= and a file =|run.pl|=
in the current directory. By default the server is configured to run on
port 3020. If you prefer another port, edit the file
=|config-enabled/network.pl|=. Now you are ready to run ClioPatria using
the command below.

    ==
    ./run.pl
    ==

Next direct your browser to =|http://localhost:3020|= (or whatever port
you selected) and enter a name and password for the administrator user.


---++ Creating a project in MS-Windows

The procedure in Windows is a bit different  because it is not very easy
to start Prolog from a  directory  while   loading  a  file from another
directory. In a sense, it is simpler:

*|Double click|* =|setup.pl|= as found in the =ClioPatria= folder. This
opens a standard browse-for-directory dialog. Enter the desired
directory and Prolog will initialise this directory with a ClioPatria
project.

[[alert.gif]] As of SWI-Prolog 5.11.14, the dialog allows for creating
the target folder.  If your SWI-Prolog is older you must first create
the target folder.

After (optionally) editing =|config-enabled\network.pl|= in the target
directory, *|double click|* =|run.pl|= in the target folder and direct
your browser to =|http://localhost:3020|= (or whatever port you
selected).  Enter a name and password for the administrator user.
