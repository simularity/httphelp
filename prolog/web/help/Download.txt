# Downloading ClioPatria

ClioPatria can be downloaded using the [[GIT][http://git-scm.com/]]
version control system only. Why? Because ClioPatria's package manager
CPACK is based on GIT, so you need GIT anyway.

## Step one, get GIT

You probably already have GIT. Otherwise go to its
[home](http://git-scm.com/).

## Step two, get SWI-Prolog

Download and install [[SWI-Prolog][http://www.swi-prolog.org]]. Most
of the time, the [development
version](http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/devel) of SWI-Prolog is
your safest choice to enjoy all features.

[[alert.gif]] In particular, binary packages provided by most Linux
distributions are often too far behind. We advice to install the latest
development version from source.  It you run Ubuntu, we provide
[PPAs for releases](http://www.swi-prolog.org/build/Debian.txt).

## Step three, download ClioPatria

With GIT installed, this is simple. Open a terminal in the right
directory and run the command below, which creates a directory
=ClioPatria= in the current directory.

    ==
    % git clone https://github.com/ClioPatria/ClioPatria.git
