---+ The ClioPatria plugin architecture

ClioPatria plugins are Prolog source-files that can do two things:

  * Define hooks to alter the behavior of the existing application.
  Supported hooks are documented in hooks.pl.
  * Create an HTTP service.  Such services come in two types:
    * Services that produce HTML for human consumption
    * Services that produce XML or JSON for machines.

Plugins can be added to ClioPatria in many different ways. To preserve
best modularity, we suggest to add plugins to the configuration
directory =|config-enabled|=.  Standard plugins are provided in the
directory =|config-available|=.  In addition, most packages come with
a =|config-available|= directory.

If ClioPatria is configures (using configure (Unix) or setup.pl
(Windows), it installs a default configuration of plugins in
=|config-enabled|=.  This default is determined by the file *DEFAULTS*,
in the directory =|config-available|=.  This file contains Prolog terms
of the format:

    ==
    config(File, Action).
    ==

Here, File is a reference to a file in the config directory and Action
is one of

    * link
    Try to install the file using a _link_.  This is used for plugin
    files that are typically need no further editing.  If linking is
    not provided by the platform, the file is _copied_.

    * copy
    Install the file by copying.  This is typically used for files that
    need further configuration.
