---+ Status and plans with CPACK

CPACK is still immature. However, it is based on flexible
state-of-the-art technology such as GIT for version tracking and RDF for
metadata. The system is intended as a prototype for a package manager
for SWI-Prolog. New facilities will be added on as-needed basis. Below
is a wishlist.

  * When updating/accepting a package, do some sanity checks first.
  * Provide support for removing package, indicating possible dependency
    problems.
  * Deal with conflicts.  For example, allow packages to work only with
    a certain branch of another package.
  * Provide a rating system.
  * Provide ClioPatria 1.0-style clustered search
  * Provide a network of trust between users and (cloned) package
    servers.
