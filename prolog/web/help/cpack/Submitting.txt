---+ Submitting a CPACK

A CPACK is uploaded by making its publically accessible GIT repository
known to a CPACK repository server, e.g.,
http://cliopatria.swi-prolog.org. Submitting or upgrading a pack
requires you to logged on.  This is done using the form accessible
through *|CPACK/Submit pack|*. Optionally, you may direct the server to
a specific _branch_.

The repository server clones (using =|git clone --mirror|=) your
repository and makes the mirror available though the =|git://|=
protocol.  In addition, it performs the following steps:

  1. Fetch the metadata from =|<pack>/rdf/cpack/<pack>.ttl|=, which
  must be a valid RDF/Turtle file.  Details on this file are in
  [[metadata][metadata.txt]].

  2. Perform a cross-reference analysis on all Prolog (*.pl) files.
  This analysis tries to find possible issues with the package:

    * Files using the same *module* as used by some other file.
    Such files cannot be loaded together, so the packages are
    reported as _conflicting_.
    * Files appearing in the same *location* as files from other
    packages.  This makes file-search ambiguous and is again reported
    as a _conflict_.
    * Validate that all *|file referenced|* can be resolved, either by
    the package itself, another package (a _dependency_), ClioPatria
    or the Prolog libraries.
    * Validate that all *|predicate calls|* can be resolved, either from
    the files themselves, one of the imported files or Prolog.
    * Validate that imports from different files to not try to import
    the *|same predicate|* into the same module.

  If any problem is found, the package is flagged with an `alert' icon
  and the package page provides additional information on the conflict.
  Please try to resolve the conflict and upgrade the affected packages.
