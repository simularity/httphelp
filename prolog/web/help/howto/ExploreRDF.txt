---+ Exploring RDF loaded into ClioPatria

ClioPatria offers browsing capabilities over the loaded RDF. These
facilities are intended primarily for the developer, but may also be
suitable for _backoffice_ applications.  The browser has two entry
points:

    * The *|top-right box|* provides autocompletion *search* for
    literals that _start_ with the string you type. If a string is
    selected, it shows a table with all subject-predicate (S-P) pairs
    that have this literal as object. From there, one may browse to the
    desired resources.

    * The _|Places/Graphs|_ menu provides an overview of all available
    *|named graphs|*. Clicking a graph shows statistics on the
    predicates, subjects and classes available from that graph. Notably
    the predicate table may provide useful insight in your data. The
    graph-info also allows *downloading* the graph.

Selecting an individual resource shows the [[Local View][LocalView.txt]]
if the resource, together with the [[Context Graph][CustomContext.txt]].
The local view shows the properties and their values. The context graph
identifies object-relations that place the object in its (hierarchical)
context.

*Literals* that are *underlined* appear multiple times in the graph.
Hovering shows the number of times the literal appears and clicking
shows all S-P pairs that share the same literal.

     your application.
