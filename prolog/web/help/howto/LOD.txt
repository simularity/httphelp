---+ Providing LOD services from ClioPatria

LOD (Linked Open Data)  means  that   URIs  (indentiers)  and  also URLs
(resource locators for which  you  can   get  content).  The  content is
typically either a human explanation or an   RDF graph. The RDF graph is
commonly referred to as the `Bounded Description' (see below).

The  file  api(lod)  implements  the    ClioPatria   LOD  server,  while
config-available/lod.pl provides a starting point   for  configuring your
LOD server.

@see http://linkeddata.org/ for more background on LOD.
@see library(semweb/rdf_describe) for bounded graph implementations
