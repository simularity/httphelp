---+ Linking from your application to the ClioPatria browser

The ClioPatria _backoffice_ facilities are not intended for the
end-user (i.e., the application you built for a wide adience), but may
come handy for applications intended for expert users.  In that case,
you may wish to use predicates from

    * components(label) such as rdf_link//1 to emit a label for a
    resource that is a link to its _|local view|_.

    * applications(browse) to embed one of the views or tables into
    your page.

The demo prophier.pl provides a complete and   ready to run example that
displays the property-hierarchy of  the  loaded   RDF.  It  links to the
ClioPatria local view by means of  the   rdf_link//1  call  in this code
fragment:

    ==
    emit_children([]) --> [].
    emit_children([node(P,Children)|T]) -->
	html(li([ \rdf_link(P)		% Create link to local view
		| \emit_tree(Children)
		])),
	emit_children(T).
    ==

To see the program in action, make sure   to have some RDF loaded (e.g.,
OWL from the library; see LoadRDF.txt).  Now, load prophier.pl. This can
be done using the command below from   the  Prolog console or by copying
prophier.pl into =|config-enabled|= and restarting ClioPatria.

    ==
    ?- use_module(web/help/howto/prophier).
    ==

Now reload the page in  your  browser   to  update  the  menu and select
_|Places/Predicate tree|_.

@see prophier.pl provides the complete code.
