---+ Loading RDF into ClioPatria

The RDF store of ClioPatria is initially empty.  There are many ways to
load RDF.

    1. Login and use the actions from the _Repository_ menu to manage
    the database.

    2. Load them from the Prolog command line using rdf_load/1.  If you
    wish to use this route frequently, it is advised to activate
    config-available/debug.pl to make the core RDF library available from
    the toplevel. See the [[installation][../Install.txt]] instructions.
    Then continue with e.g.,

    ==
    ?- rdf_load('myfile.rdf').
    ?- rdf_load('http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core').
    ==

    By default, the system understands XML/RDF and Turtle and can load
    from local files and HTTP servers.  The plugin mechanism of
    library(semweb/rdf_db) can be used to extend the formats that are
    understood and the locations from which they can be loaded.  In
    particular, activating the config-available/zlib.pl config skeleton
    allows loading from compressed data sources.

    ==
    ?- rdf_load('myfile.rdf.gz').
    ==

    3. Add the locations to the library manager and load them either
    through the menu _|Repository/Load from library|_ or
    rdf_load_library/1.  ClioPatria comes with a default library
    in the directory =ontologies=.  See ontologies/README.txt.
    The file config-available/ontopath.pl provides a configuration
    skeleton.

    Details of the library structure are described in the SWI-Prolog
    documentation for the
    [[semweb][http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/package/semweb.html]]
    package, in the section named _|Managing RDF input files|_
