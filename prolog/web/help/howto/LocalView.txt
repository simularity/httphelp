---+ The Local View for a resource

The *|Local View|* describes a single resource. It shows four aspects of
a resource.

  1. A table holding the predicates and objects for this resource
  2. A description of the named graphs involved
  3. Where the resource is used as an object
  4. The _|Context Graph|_

---++ Programming the Local View

The Local View is provided by   the HTML component list_resource//2. Its
view can be customized to satisfy certain datasets:

  * The hook cliopatria:predicate_order/2 may be used to change the
  order of predicates in the table or delete predicates from the table.
  * The cliopatria:bnode_label//1 can be used to customize the
  presentation of blank nodes.
  * The context graph may be [[customized][CustomContext.txt]] as well

@see CustomContext.txt for configuring the context graph
