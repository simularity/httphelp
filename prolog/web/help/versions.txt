---+ About ClioPatria versions

ClioPatria was started as part of [[MultimediaN Eculture
Project][http://e-culture.multimedian.nl/]]. This version was an
integral part of the _|MultimediaN E-Culture Demonstrator|_ that won
first prize as semantic web application at ISWC 2006.  We call that
*|version one|*.

Later, the application specific code was abstracted a bit, allowing to
_skin_ the application and put other data into it. This version still
uses the `kitchen-sink model', which makes it almost inacessible for
anyone but its developers. We call that *|version two|*.

The current version is fairly _lean_, which should make it more
versatile and accessible.  It can be extended using packages.  The
package system is called CPACK (ClioPatria Package).  This version
will be *|version three|*.  It is not really there, but we call the
current version *|2.9|* to prepare the transition.  Here are the
main plans before we will call it *|3.0|*:

  * Some parts of ClioPatria will move into packages.
  * Some parts of the kitchen-sink ClioPatria will be made available as
  packages too.
  * The package manager and configuration manager needs more polishing.

From now on, we will try to keep ClioPatria stable, lean and backward
compatible.
