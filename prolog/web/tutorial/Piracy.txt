---+ An Linked Open Piracy tutorial

This tutorial explains the basics of installing ClioPatria and applying
it to analyze RDF data and write a small web-service.

The pirates domain is a geospatial domain. To keep this tutorial simple
and considering the size of the dataset, we use naive Prolog
generate-and-test for answering queries. In realistic settings one needs
proper spatial indexing. This is implemented in the [[space
pachkage][http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/package/space.html]]

An LOP demo is [[online][http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/poseidon/ns]]

We are grateful to the [[Poseidon
project][http://www.esi.nl/short/poseidon/]] for making the RDF data
available. Willem Robert van Hage convinced me using this data. This
material was used in guest lecture by Frank van Harmelen and Jan
Wielemaker, part of a Prolog course at the [[VU][http://www.vu.nl]]
organised by Stefan Schlobach and Annette ten Teije.
